# Admin Automation Scripts

This repository contains small, practical automation scripts written in Python to reduce repetitive admin work and streamline everyday tasks.

The goal is simple: use lightweight code to save time, stay organised, and improve efficiency.

## What This Repo Will Include

As I build and refine scripts, they will appear here. Planned examples include:

- File and folder sorting tools  
- Filename cleaning and formatting scripts  
- Quick report generators  
- Simple data converters  
- Checklist or log generators  
- Any repetitive task that can be automated with a few lines of Python  

These scripts will grow over time as I identify useful routines to automate.
